== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How I can use the shortcodes? =
[See teachPress shortcode reference](http://mtrv.wordpress.com/teachpress/shortcode-reference/)

= How can I add a course list in a page or post? = 
If you writing a post or page use the following tag: [tpcourselist]

= How can I add the enrollment system in my blog? =
Create a new page or post and use the following tag: [tpenrollments]

= How can I add longer course desciptions? =
Write a long course desciption as normal WordPress pages and add this page as related content to the course.

= How can I display images in publication lists? =
An example: [tplist image="left" image_size="70"]. Important: You must specify both image parameters.

= How can I split publication lists into multiple pages? =
An example: [tpcloud pagination="1" entries_per_page="50"]. This works also for [tplist] and [tpsearch]

= How can I protect course documents? =
The plugin saves course documents in your WordPress upload directory under /teachpress/*course_id*. You can add a protection for this directory with a .htaccess file without influence to your normal media files.

= How can I deactivate parts of the plugin? =
If you want to use only one part of the plugin, so write the following in the wp-config.php of your WordPress installation
`// For deactivating the course system:  
define ('TP_COURSE_SYSTEM','disable');  
// For deactivating the publication system:  
define ('TP_PUBLICATION_SYSTEM','disable');  `

= I see only error messages if I use the RSS-Feed for publications or the xls/csv export for enrollments. What's wrong? =
If you save plugins outside the normal path (/wp-content/plugins/), the plugin can't load required WordPress files in some cases. Solution: Change the path in the following plugin files: export.php (line 9) / feed.php (line 13).
